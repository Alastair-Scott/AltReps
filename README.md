# AltReps

AltReps is an addon that allows you to track reputations across your characters with the following features:
  - Reputations broken down by expansion for each character
  - Shows paragon reputation
  - Flags reputations from whom you may claim a supply chest
  - Lets you know how many supply chests each character has claimed
  - Shows an approximation of the gold earned from opening supply chests

### How to use

AltReps will create a logo on your minimap that you may click to display the main window, showing all of the tracked information. Right clicking the logo will open up a configuration page.

Another option is to use ```/ar toggle``` to show the main window, and ```/ar config``` to bring up the configuration menu

### Special Thanks
I just wanted to say thank you to the amazing team over at [SavedInstances](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/saved_instances) for their hard work and brilliant addon. Their efforts provided me with a base from which to create AltReps, and I wouldn't have been able to do this without them!
